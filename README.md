## About

This serves as the back-end of a forum web application that allows users to make posts around video game achievements.
This will include; posting tips and guides, posting partner searches for achievements that require 
other people and events for achievements that require a large number of people. All major achievement supporting 
platforms, including; Steam, Xbox and Playstation will have their own sections.

[Here is the front-end part](https://github.com/SneakyShrike/achievement-forum-webapp) of the web app that compliments this.
